# üí§ SleepTracker

## Overview
**SleepTracker** is a cross-platform mobile app developed using Angular and Ionic. It allows users to log and visualize their overnight sleep patterns and daytime sleepiness using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. Designed with usability, mobile responsiveness, and data persistence in mind, this app supports both iOS and Android platforms.

## How to Run
### Browser Preview
bash
npm install
ionic serve

### Mobile Preview:
ionic build
npx cap add ios/android
npx cap open ios/android

---

### Development Time: 
10-15 hours of design, coding, debugging, and testing.

---

### Resources Consulted: 
Ionic Framework Docs, Angular Documentation, Ionic Storage, Stack Overflow (various syntax/debugging)

---

### Collaboration:
Developed independently. Participated in peer discussions and reviewed class threads for debugging techniques, especially on data storage and state persistence.

---
### Reflections
This project gave me hands-on experience with hybrid app development, component-based design, and local data storage. I practiced balancing functionality with UX simplicity and ensured cross-device responsiveness ‚Äî a solid foundation for future mobile health tracking apps.
